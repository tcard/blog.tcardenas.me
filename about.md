title: About me
---

I'm <strong>Toni Cárdenas</strong>, a guy.

I'm from Málaga, Spain, and I'm living in Madrid, Spain, together with a bunch of animals, including a girl, <strike>a baby boy</strike> two kids, and <strike>four</strike> five cats.

My main activities are eating, sleeping, mindlessly scrolling through some piece of the Internec, and throwing lines of code for <strike>[Ably](https://ably.io)</strike> <strike>[Cabify](https://twitter.com/CabifyDev)</strike> and maybe some personal project.

Have a look at [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/tcardev), [my GitHub](https://github.com/tcard) or my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tcardenasv).

No cool/funny picture to put here yet.
