title: About me
---

I'm <strong>Toni Cárdenas</strong>, a guy.

I'm from Málaga, Spain, and I'm living in Sabadell, near Barcelona, Spain, together with a bunch of animals, including a girl, a baby boy, and <strike>four</strike> five cats.

My main activities are eating, sleeping, mindlessly scrolling through some piece of the Internec, and throwing lines of code for [Ably](https://ably.io) and maybe some personal project.

Have a look at [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/tcardv), [my GitHub](https://github.com/tcard) or my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tcardenasv).

No cool/funny picture to put here yet.
