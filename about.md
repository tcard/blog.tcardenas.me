I'm Toni Cárdenas, a guy.

I'm from Málaga, Spain, and I'm living in Sabadell, near Barcelona, Spain, together with a bunch of animals, including a girl and <strike>four</strike> and five cats.

My main activities are eating, sleeping, mindlessly scrolling through some piece of the Internec, and throwing lines of code for [Ably](https://ably.io) and maybe some personal project.

No cool/funny picture to put here yet.
